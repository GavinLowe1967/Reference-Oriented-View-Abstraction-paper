The \emph{parameterised verification problem} seeks to verify all members of
some collection of systems.  We consider the parameterised verification
problem applied to systems that are composed of an arbitrary number of
\emph{component processes}, together with some \emph{fixed processes}.
Processes synchronise together corresponding to steps of the system.  
Each component process has an \emph{identity} which may be passed to another
process and stored, and possibly subsequently passed to other processes.
Hence each process may store some references to other processes. 

We apply a variant of \emph{view abstraction} to this problem.  We define a
\emph{view} to record the state of the fixed processes, a particular component
called the principal, and all the components to which the principal holds a
reference.  Our approach calculates an upper bound on all views of all states
of systems with an arbitrary number of components.  In particular, we use
techniques based on symmetry reduction to form this bound.

\section{Introduction}

The \emph{parameterised verification problem} considers a collection of
systems $P(x)$ where the parameter~$x$ ranges over a potentially infinite set,
and asks whether such systems are correct for all values of~$x$.  In this
paper we consider the following instance of the parameterised verification
problem.  Each system is built from some number of \emph{component processes},
together with some \emph{fixed processes}.  The components may be taken from
one or more families; for instance, we will consider examples representing a
concurrent datatype based on a linked list: one family of components will
represent threads operating on the datatype; and another family will represent
nodes in the linked list.  All components from a particular family will be
symmetric to one another.  Thus these systems are parameterised by the number
of components from each family.  The fixed processes are independent
of the number of components; we use them to model shared resources such as
shared variables or locks; we also normally include a \emph{watchdog} as a
fixed process, which monitors the execution and signals an error if the
desired specification is not met.

The components and fixed processes synchronise together corresponding to a
system step.  For example, a system step where a thread reads or writes a
field of a node will correspond to a synchronisation between the thread and
the node; likewise, a system step where a thread reads or writes a shared
variable will correspond to a synchronisation between the thread and the fixed
process for the variable.  We call each synchronisation an \emph{event}: they
are analogous to CSP events.

Each component has an \emph{identity}, drawn from some potentially infinite
set.  These identities can be passed in events; thus a process can obtain the
identity of a component process, and possibly pass it on to a third process.
This means that each process has a potentially infinite state space (a finite
control state combined with identities from a potentially infinite set).  When
process~$p$ holds the identity of a component~$c$, we say that $p$ has a
\emph{reference} to~$c$.  We describe the setting for our work more formally
in the next section.

The problem (of showing that a system with $n$ components is correct, for
all~$n$) is undecidable in general~\cite{apt-kozen,tomasz-gavin-CA}; however,
verification techniques prove effective on a number of specific instances.

We apply the technique of \emph{view abstraction} to this problem; the general
technique was originally developed by Abdulla et al.~\cite{AHH}, and
subsequently adapted to this setting by us~\cite{gavin:view-abs}.
The idea of view abstraction is that we abstract each system
state by its \emph{views}, where each view records the states of the fixed
processes, but just some subset of the components.  

For each analysis, we fix a set of views of interest; for example, we might
consider all views containing precisely two component states (plus the fixed
processes).  We then calculate an upper bound on the set of such views of all
reachable states of all systems of arbitrary size.  By reasoning about this
set of views, we can show that all such systems are correct.

In the earlier papers, each view contained some fixed number~$k$ of components
(in~\cite{gavin:view-abs} we allowed the number of components from particular
families to also be restricted).  This suffers from a state-space explosion:
many views contain components that are uncorrelated; these do not help to
capture useful properties of the system; but they do add a lot of states to
the analysis.  

In this paper we propose a variant of view abstraction that aims to overcome
this state-space explosion, by restricting the set of views we consider.  Each
view is based on a particular component, which we call the \emph{principal}.
The view contains the state of the principal~$p$, the state of each component
to which $p$ has a reference, and the fixed processes.
